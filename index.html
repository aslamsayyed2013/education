            <p class="text-small">Technology education is the study of technology, in which students "learn about the
                processes and knowledge related to technology".[1] As a field of study, it covers the human ability to
                shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and tools with techniques.
                It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of
                technologies used and how to fix them.[2] This emergent discipline seeks to</p>

            <p class="text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by
                the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of
                the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children
                aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.</p>

            <p class="text-small">The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to reach
                students who couldn't be on a university campus.[1] By the early 1900s, communication technologies
                improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of
                Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to
                educational broadcasting.[1] Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded through the
                invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. </p>
